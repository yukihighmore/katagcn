tensorflow 2.6.0

Too busy to write clear and detailed README.
The ONLY key point is numpy == 1.19.5 tensorflow-gpu == 2.6.0 pandas == 1.4.1

When I get a good job offer, I will rewrite some files.
If you have any problem, plz send email to me dirictly.
I mean do not not contact my mentor, plz.
And because of network problem, I seldom sign in github, sry.
